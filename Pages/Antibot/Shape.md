### How to Identify Shape Bot Defence
[Wappalyzer Chrome Extension](https://github.com/reanalytics-databoutique/webscraping-open-doc/blob/0386528f99a1209a538f6d042e859cd9933011c8/Pages/Tools/Wappalyzer.md) doesn't seem to recognize it, we've noticed that certain websites protected by Shape, if opened by a browser in incognito mode and with developer tools tab opened, they stop to work. Closing the developer tools tab, they work again.

### Recommended approach to Akamai Bot Manager
**BEST CHOICE**:  at the moment, the best approach is a [Playwright](https://github.com/reanalytics-databoutique/webscraping-open-doc/blob/main/Pages/Tools/Playwright.md) + [Stealth](https://github.com/reanalytics-databoutique/webscraping-open-doc/blob/main/Pages/Tools/Playwright_stealth.md) but cannot be enough. The scraper should mimic a plausible user interaction with the website, we'll share an example soon.
