# Browser Fingerprinting

## What is Browser Fingerprinting?
Browser fingerprinting is a powerful method that websites use to collect information about your browser type and version, as well as your operating system, active plugins, time zone, language, screen resolution and various other active settings. Like other fingerprinting techniques, these datapoints are matched inside a database of known profiles to see if the visitor is a real person or an automated program.
To get these all these details, some of the techniques used are:
