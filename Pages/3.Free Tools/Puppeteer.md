## Our View on Puppeteer

### Usage Rating of Puppeteer
**SECOND CHOICE**: Although not preferred, still an acceptable choice. Can be controlled via Javascript, not our language of choice.
Since its features are very similar to [Playwright](https://github.com/reanalytics-databoutique/webscraping-open-doc/blob/main/Pages/Tools/Playwright.md) (part of the team of Playwright came from Puppeteer project), we prefer Playwright for its multiple browser support. 

### When to use Puppeteer
When we need a full browser rendering the page and [Playwright](https://github.com/reanalytics-databoutique/webscraping-open-doc/blob/main/Pages/Tools/Playwright.md) and [Selenium](https://github.com/reanalytics-databoutique/webscraping-open-doc/blob/main/Pages/Tools/Selenium.md) can't help. The choice is made only due to the fact that we're Python experts and don't have any experience in Javascript.
