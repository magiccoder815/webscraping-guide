## Our View on Puppeteer

### Usage Rating of Puppeteer
**SECOND CHOICE**: Although not preferred, still an acceptable choice. Can be controlled via Javascript, not our language of choice.
Since its features are very similar to Playwright (part of the team of Playwright came from Puppeteer project), we prefer Playwright for its multiple browser support. 

### When to use Puppeteer
When we need a full browser rendering the page and Playwright and Selenium can't help. The choice is made only due to the fact that we're Python experts and don't have any experience in Javascript.
