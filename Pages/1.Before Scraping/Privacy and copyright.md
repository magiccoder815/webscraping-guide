# Is the data I want to scrape compliant with privacy laws or copyrighted?
**This is not a legal advice, please refer to a lawyer if you're in doubt**
Another aspect needed to be considered before starting a web scraping project is about the kind of data we're retrieving. 
## Personal data or PII
Unless you have the person's explicit consent it is now illegal to scrape an EU resident's personal data under GDPR and this should be enough to make you stop from any personal data gathering. It's very difficult to know before scraping the citizenship of a person whose data is going to be scraped and in any case, there are similar rules also in other countries, making the scraping of personal data prohibitive.

In this great article by [Zyte](https://www.zyte.com/blog/web-scraping-gdpr-compliance-guide/#:~:text=Scraping%20sensitive%20data%20means%20that,you%20should%20avoid%20scraping%20it.) it's explained how to behave to be compliant with GDPR, which is only valid in Europe.

## Copyrighted Data
[Unless you're OpenAI](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/05/authors-file-a-lawsuit-against-openai-for-unlawfully-ingesting-their-books), you cannot scrape copyrighted material and hope to win a case in court.
So limit your operation on what is publicly available and it's factual, not made by someone who can claim the data as its own. This means also to don't scraping and store pictures made by professional photographers, not limited to artistic pictures but also pictures made for fashion websites.
